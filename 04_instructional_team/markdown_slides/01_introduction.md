# Deep Learning: Introduction to Deep Learning

```
$ echo "Data Sciences Institute"
```

---

# Warning: This lecture is more theoretical compared to the other lectures.

# Goal of the class

## Overview

* When and where to use DL
* "How" it works
* Frontiers of DL

## Using DL

* Implement using `Numpy`, and `Tensorflow` (`Keras`)
* Engineering knowledge for building and training DL

---
# What is Deep Learning

* Good old Neural Networks, with more layers/modules
* Non-linear, hierarchical, abstract representations of data
* Flexible models with any input/output type and size
* Differentiable Functional Programming

# Libraries & Frameworks

![w:800](./images/01_frameworks.png)

This lecture is using **Keras**: high level frontend for **TensorFlow** (and MXnet, Theano, CNTK)

One lab will be dedicated to a short **Pytorch** introduction.

# Computation Graph

![w:800](./images/computation_graph_simple_f.png)

Neural network = parametrized, non-linear function

---
# Computation Graph

![w:700](./images/computation_graph_simple.png)

Computation graph: Directed graph of functions, depending on parameters (neuron weights)

---

# Computation Graph

![w:700](./images/computation_graph_simple_expl.png)

Combination of linear (parametrized) and non-linear functions

---

# Computation Graph

![w:700](./images/computation_graph_complicated.png)

Not only sequential application of functions

---

# Computation Graph

![](./images/computation_graph_backprop.png)
* Automatic computation of gradients: all modules are **differentiable**!
* Theano (now Aesara), **Tensorflow 1**, etc. build a static computation graph via static declarations.
* **Tensorflow 2**, **PyTorch**, **JAX**, etc. rely on dynamic differentiable modules: "define-by-run".
* Vector computation on **CPU** and accelerators (**GPU** and **TPU**).

# Computation Graph

![](./images/computation_graph_backprop.png)

Simple keras implementation

```py
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(H, input_dim=N))  # defines W0
model.add(Activation("tanh"))
model.add(Dense(K))               # defines W1
model.add(Activation("softmax"))
```
